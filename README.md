# G-Project

## What is G-Project?
> G-Project is an External Trade learning record. It's a challenge when you move into a new field or I could say it's a new subject, because this project not only goes through the general process but mixed some new technology within, like Python, Web development, Data Analysis and Internet Protocol. I hope you enjoying the journey in External Trade.
