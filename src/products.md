## Letter

### How to write a Professional Email

#### 1. Use a professional email address

#### 2. Have a simple and clear subject

#### 3. Begin with a positive greeting (Emailing someone for the first time, it's better to give a positive vibes to the reader.)

#### 4. Mention the CTA (call to action)

What is CTA?

> CTA (call to action) is a marking term refering to the next step, a marketer wanna its audiences(customers) to take. For instance:
> 
> - Reply to teh email with the followling details. (Leaving info, phone number, social media link)
> - Can we talk about the product details on WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter ...
>   Let me konw a suitable time and contact details(info), to schedule a call ...

---

#### 5. Add a closing remarks

Closing remarks give the finishing touch to the email, it's just using the simple sentence as the greeting we mention before. For instance:

> - Looking forward to work with you on this.
> - Feel free to call me on [phone number]/to get in touch with me on WhatsApp Link [xxxx](or others)
> - Waiting for your positive response (Sir/Madam) to take it further.

#### 6. Use professional signatures

Adding a professional signatures to the end of the email. It could include the company's full name and website which links to the social media(if exists). Sign off the email with a **'Sincerely'**, **'Regards'**, **'Best regards'**. For instance:

> **Regards**  
> Elias Everett,  
> Jhon D,  
> Lee J  
> 
> Ying Kang Wire Mesh Product Co., Ltd

or

> **Sincerely**  
> Elias Everettt,
> 
> Ying Kang Wire Mesh Product Co., Ltd  
> Phone/Ph: +(1) 000-000-0000 / +(86) 0000-00000000  
> Email: xxxx@xx.com  
> Website: [China Wire Mesh-YingKang](www.wirenetting-china.com)

#### 7. Grammer / Spelling Check

When the email has completed writing, read the email again from the reader's perspective and ensure the spelling and grammer is ok.

#### 8. Do not insert link(s) directly in the email

I personally thought insert link(s) in the email is very useful in any situation, but the email fliter system just marked links, pictures as spam or moving emial to the trash.

## Terms

### International Commercial Terms

Incoterms, short for International Commercial Terms. Each Incoterms does one of two main things.

- To determine at what point the responsibility and ownership for the shipment transfers from **the seller** to **the buyer**.

- To determine who is **responsible for**, or who **pays for**, the transportation of the goods, import and export processes, insurance, loading and unloading, and the like.

There're ***11*** Incoterms can be roughly divided into **three groups**:

- First: EXW, FCA, FAS, FOB (It's **the buyer** who pays for the **shipping costs**, I could say they're **ideal** when we're negotiating)

- Second: CFR, CIF, CPT, CIP (There're the terms under which **the seller pay the main shipping costs** and include them in their price. There's a point that the seller pays for shipping, **the goods travel at the buyer's risk,** so in general the buyer wanna investigate **insurance**.)

- Third: DAT, DAP, DDP (Here, the shipping costs are paid by **the seller** and **the seller assumes all the travel risk**. In these cases, the seller will want to consider

#### EXW

EXW (EX works) is a shipping arrangement in which a seller makes a product available at a specific location, but the buyer has to pay the transport costs. 

Once **the buyer have their goods**, then they have responsible for other risks, such as loading the goods onto trucks or container, transfering them to ship or plane and comply with costomes regulations.

It's particularly good for the seller, but not so good for the buyer. In EXW, the seller is only required to safely package the goods, lable them appropriately, and deliver them to a previously agreed-upon location.

#### FOB

FOB (Free on board) is used to indicate whether the seller or the buyer is liable (Laws) for goods that are damaged or destroyed **during shipping**. 

Definition: The seller must deliver the goods to the buyer before shipment date, and the seller has responsibile  for all the costs and risks (damaged or destroyed) until the cargo is on board. Loading costs are under these extended FOB term: ***FOB Liner terms***, ***FOB under tackle***, ***FOB stowed (FOBS)***, ***FOB trimmed (FOBT)***.

- FOB Liner terms: The shipping costs are paid by the buyer.

- FOB under tackle: The buyer paid the costs ever since the cargo was tackling.

- FOB stowed (FOBS): The seller is in charge of loading and has the responsibility for the loading costs and included stowage costs.

- FOB trimmed (FOBT): It's a little bit similar to FOBS, but the seller paid the loading costs and trimmed costs.

Total amount: Cost + Packing fee + Land freight(LCL, FCL) + Port surcharge

> **LCL (Less than container load)** means the volume of cargo is less than the capacity of container while **FCL (Full container load)** indicates the cargo is fully loaded on.

Format: FOB [Origin] PRICE: USD [Amount]

#### CNF/CFR

CNF (Cost and Freight), in simplicity, is **FOB + Freight.** The buyer does take all the cost and risks before the cargo has arrived. Caution! There's **no insurance** in CNF.

Format: CNF [destination] PRICE: USD [Amount]

#### CIF

CIF (Cost, Insurance and Freight) is similar to CNF, which just adds the ***insurance***.

Format: CIF [destination] PRICE: USD [Amount]

#### Door to Door(D2D)

This term is against the personal buyer, the seller has responsibility for all the costs before the cargo has arrived in the buyer's hands.

#### FCA

FCA (Free Carrier)

---

### Terms for payment options

Letters of credit

> A letter of credit is issued from one bank to another bank (usually in another country) to guarantee that payments will be made to a party on time. (Include the correct amount, and other possibly specified conditions) Once get a letter of credit from buyer, you're sure you'll get paid.

### Work Report

Ying-Kang Wire Mesh Product.

As of this date, rolling in a new field, mesh products, that's interesting. I've learnt some new knowledge:

- What's the Wire Mesh and what's it made.

- Products: Anti Climb Fence, Chain Link Fence, Removable Fence(or we'd call Canada Fence), Crowd Control Fence, etc. And the applications of these products are so wide. It's been everywhere in our lives.

- How to use git (an open software) with remote work.

- What is finishing (Surface Treatment) and how does it work.
